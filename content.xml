It must be noted that this definition place emphasis on the success of a business, meaning that competitors are not included as stakeholders because they have an interest in the business but not its success. &#13;
The concept of stakeholder accepts that a business should consider the interest of all stakeholders in its activities and decisions rather than just shareholders’. It emphasises on the responsibilities and obligations that a business has to different groups or individuals who come into contact with the business. In other words, what a business would be reasonably expected to provide to these groups or individuals. For instance: &#13;
•	Owners – who are interested in how much profit the business makes and earn dividends.&#13;
•	Managers – who are concerned about their salary.&#13;
•	Workers and Unions – who want to earn high wages and keep their jobs.&#13;
•	Customers – who want the business to produce quality products and services at reasonable prices.&#13;
•	Suppliers – who want the business to continue to order from them.&#13;
•	The government – pay taxes on time and without any illegal manipulation of accounts.&#13;
This privatisation will affect each stakeholder differently; each of the groups will benefit from this change and may as well be on the losing side. For instance:&#13;

The government sold 40% of the assets of Mauritius Telecom (MT), a very successful state-owned enterprise, to France Telecom, in spite of protests from the trade unions and the workers. At Mauritius Telecom, the Telecommunications Workers Union (TWU) describes the deal as a "total failure and political fraud", suggesting that France Telecom has not lived up to the promises made to the population. The trade unionist believes that France Telecom has emerged as the big winner in the deal as 500 employees have left the company since 2000 and the quality of the services "has never been so bad".</title></topic></topics></children></topic><topic id="3pn1i1dvlgte7uo5e4lv0s1t5i" structure-class="org.xmind.ui.tree.left" timestamp="1371394672526"><title>Customers</title><children><topics type="attached"><topic id="7233n80gb7vsjkbgne4mdlhnug" timestamp="1371394700385"><title>Customers want top quality products and services and lowest prices.

•	The corporate culture – Shareholders/Owners took the risk to earn returns whereas government was elected to create jobs and provide job security. At times these objectives tend to conflict.&#13;
•	Public sector or private sector businesses – State-owned organisation tend not to have profit as a major objective rather than providing quality service to end users. On the other hand, private sector tends to provide quality service at a profit.&#13;
•	Ethics – Ethical behaviour tend to have a major role in government decision making and government have the greatest corporate social responsibility. Ethics regarding private sector tend to be a secondary factor. However some private sector businesses tend to be more ethical in their operation since Nike’s sweatshop scandal, while others still see behaving ethically as an eye wash.&#13;
&#13;
Business objectives are the aims or targets that a business works towards. Businesses of any size can benefit from having clear objectives to work towards. The business aim helps direct, control and review the success of business activity.&#13;

The aims of these organisations can vary greatly. For instance, a private sector company might downsize its operation to minimise cost no matter whether people are laid off. However, a state owned organisation would continue to operate even with negative returns, with the aim to preserve employment of workers. This makes an interesting contrast. When the service they provide is not charged for, for example, education and health services, then a financial is inappropriate. Instead, ‘quality of service’ measures are often used, for instance the maximum number of days for a patient to wait for an operation. Even businesses earning revenue in the public sector such as, the public transport company National Transport Authority, may have among their objectives the target of maintaining services in non-profitable routes. A private company would have stopped this route.</title></topic></topics></children></topic><topic id="59odabj941umur4qsuguj6t19n" structure-class="org.xmind.ui.tree.right" timestamp="1371394029170"><title>Objectives of Private sector organisations</title><children><topics type="attached"><topic id="1dp71pmstj8ht36sufu1ijj3ee" timestamp="1371394243665"><title>There is always a temptation for governments to run state industry for political reasons or as a means of influencing the national economy, for example keeping electricity prices artificially low. Thus decisions may not be taken for commercial reasons. Privatisation puts responsibility for success firmly in the hands of the managers and staff who work in the organisation. This can lead to strong motivation as they have a direct involvement in the work they do. There is a greater sense of empowerment.&#13;
For example, Mauritius Postal Services was transformed into Mauritius Post Ltd, through another form of privatisation called "corporatisation" whereby the new company is managed by the private sector with the aim of earning profits. At Mauritius Post Ltd, the quality has improved considerably with a whole range of new services offered to the population; they now go to the post offices not only to post letters but also to pay utility bills and transport licences, and collect social benefits. "It was a big challenge to convince the employees to join the new private entity because of the fear of job losses and also to reinvent, innovate and diversify the products and services offered to satisfy the public”, says Giandev Moteea, CEO of Mauritius Post Ltd. &#13;
